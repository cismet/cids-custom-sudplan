{What is SUDPLAN}

  The SUDPLAN project - Sustainable Urban Development Planner for Climate Change Adaptation -
  aims at developing a web-based planning, prediction and training tool to support decisions
  in long term urban planning. This will help to assure populationâ€™s health, comfort, safety
  and life quality as well as sustainability of investments in utilities and infrastructures
  within a changing climate. With its open nature and architectural design, SUDPLAN will
  contribute to a shared information space in Europe.

  SUDPLAN will cover:

  * Planning for environmental factors

  * Downscaling of climate model output

  * Storm water flooding and CSO management

  * River flooding

  * Air pollution
