{Run the SMS from the web}

  You can run the SMS from the web using Java Webstart. To do so choose one of the smiley faces that most likely describes 
  your feeling about the power of your computer. The main criteria are your installed JVM (32/64 bit), the amount of <free>
  RAM and the Open-GL capabilities of your system. The Globe-batch indicates whether or not the 3D component will be
  available. When using the 3D component, it is highly recommended to run the JVM with at least 2GB of <free> RAM, which
  means that a 64 bit JVM is recommended. The 32 bit JVM starters with 3D included will most likely work well. 
  However, there may be performance and/or overall SMS stability issues.

  E.g. your machine is a powerful notebook with 8GB of RAM, a 64 bit JVM and a decent graphics device, you may choose the
  smiley face with the toothy grin. If your machine only has a total of 1.5GB of RAM but you don't want to set 3D
  capabilities aside you may try the smiley face with the wavy mouth and the tear in its eye.

  If you experience issues (e.g. the SMS does not start up) this may occur because of too few RAM in your computer or 
  issues with your graphics device driver. In such cases you should start up the SMS without the integrated 3D component.
  Please note, that some browsers may not offer the correct Java Webstart version in the "Open with"-Dialog (e.g. Mozilla
  Firefox will always register the 32 bit Java Webstart, even though 64 bit is installed). If you start a downloaded JNLP 
  via a double-click, you have to make sure the correct Java Webstart version is registered for JNLP files, too.

  Don't hesitate to try out the happier smileys. Maybe your machine is more powerful than you think ;)

{Run the cismap WMS client with PE Extension from the web}

  Especially for all non-Sudplaners this is an interesting option because this application will run without a login. Thus
  anybody is able to access Sudplan results on the Pan-European level. It is recommended that you watch the 
  {{{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9949YM2gtW4} Pan-European Common Service video}} at the 
  {{{http://www.youtube.com/user/Sudplan} YouTube Sudplan channel}} first to get an idea of
  the controls of the application.
